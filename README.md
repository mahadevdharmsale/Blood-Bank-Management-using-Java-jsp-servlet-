The Blood Management project is a web-based app for efficient blood donation and transfusion management. Using JSP, HTML, CSS for the frontend and Java Servlets for the backend, it handles user authentication, data processing, and storage with MySQL. Admins manage blood inventory, donor info, and records via a dashboard.
